To run the program, give the following commands:

```




### Variables and Data Types

 variables - image(1-12) ,decision , score and finalvalue.

 Data Types - Char, int and double.


### Input and Output

I got the input from user of what they thought the images were on the numbers to see how good their eye sight was and gave them their score using their answers.

Depending on the score the program gives a different reply

### Iteration

I used a do-while loop for gathering input of the answers for the images.
